            <h1>Cooking with Asparagus</h1>
            <p>Asparagus is a low-calorie source of folate and potassium, and its stalks are high in antioxidants. Asparagus is high in roughly half the recommended daily intake of folate, a key nutrient in taming homocysteine, a substance implicated in heart disease, and is also high in potassium. Several studies indicate getting plenty of potassium may reduce the loss of calcium from the body. In addition, green asparagus is a good source of vitamin C, which helps the body produce and maintain collagen, the major structural protein component of the body's connective tissues. As if that weren’t enough, asparagus also contains substances that act as a diuretic, neutralize ammonia that causes fatigue, and protect small blood vessels from rupturing. </p>
